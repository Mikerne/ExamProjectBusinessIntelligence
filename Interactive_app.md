# Heart Disease Explorer - Business Application

## Project Overview

The **Heart Disease Explorer** is an interactive web application designed to make heart disease data analysis accessible to non-technical users. The application allows exploration, visualization, predictive modeling, and scenario testing using a **tuned Random Forest** model.

**Goals for Sprint 4:**
1. Create a web application with a simple visual interface.
2. Apply visual representations of data, analyses, and model results.
3. Provide explanation and interpretation of results for business users.
4. Collect usability feedback and improve the prototype.

## Features of the App

### 1. Data Exploration (Tab: 📊 Data)
- Display dataset sample (up to 500 rows) with summary statistics.
- Show number of rows and columns.
- Provide statistical overview using `df.describe()`.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Tab: 🔎 EDA)
- Correlation heatmap for numeric features.
- Interactive histograms for selected variables using Plotly.
- Enables users to observe distribution and relationships.

### 3. Model & Prediction (Tab: 🤖 Model & Prediction)
- Load or train a **tuned Random Forest** model with SMOTE and scaling.
- Users can adjust the **risk threshold** for 10-year CHD prediction.
  - Lower threshold → higher recall, more false positives.
  - Higher threshold → higher precision, fewer false positives.
- Display **test set metrics**:
  - ROC AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Feature importance visualization (top 15 features).
- Individual patient prediction form:
  - Users input patient features.
  - Receive personalized risk prediction (low, moderate, high risk).
- Optional SHAP explanations for model interpretability.

### 4. Clustering (Tab: 🌀 Clustering)
- Users can select 2–8 numeric features for KMeans clustering.
- Adjust the number of clusters interactively (2–6).
- Visualize clusters with color-coded **average CHD risk (%)**.
- Displays cluster-specific CHD risk alongside scatter plots.

### 5. Binned Analysis (Tab: 📈 Binned Analysis)
- Allows binning of numeric columns (3–10 bins).
- Computes mean of another selected column within each bin.
- Visualized as interactive bar charts for easy interpretation.
